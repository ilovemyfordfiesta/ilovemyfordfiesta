Hello everyone!

Thanks for visiting my profile.

My name is Maria and I am a new programmer. Currently, I am working on basic projects, specifically involving Python. My goal is to use my knowledge of biology (Biology B.S. here!), as well as Python to work with datasets/create databases. 

Enjoy my work and feel free to reach out!
